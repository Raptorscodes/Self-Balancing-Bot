# Self-Balancing-Bot using Arudino and MPU 6050 gyroscope



A two-wheeled robot that maintains balance autonomously using PID control and sensor feedback.
### Features
  - Real time angle measurement using MPU6050 IMU

  - PID control loop for stabilization

  - Continuous rotation servo motor control

  - Adjustable PID gains for performance tuning
 
### Hardware Use
  - Used an Arudino UNO for the mcrocontroller for the bot.
  - MPU6050 gyroscope sensor for measuring the angle tilt of the bot.
  - 2 continous Servo Motors.
  - 3d printed chasis.
  - Battery pack.
